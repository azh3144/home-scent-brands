## FAQ

**What makes clean-burning candles better than regular paraffin candles?**

Clean-burning candles made from soy, coconut, or palm wax produce minimal to no black soot, unlike petroleum-based paraffin candles that release residue onto walls, jars, and into air. These natural waxes burn more evenly with longer burn times while being non-toxic and better for indoor air quality, especially important for frequent candle users or those with sensitivities.

**How can I make my candles last longer and burn more evenly?**

Always trim wicks to 1/4 inch before each lighting to prevent smoking and uneven burning. On the first burn, allow the entire wax surface to melt completely—minimum 3 hours for most candles—to establish proper wax memory and prevent tunneling. Never burn candles for more than 4 hours at a time, and discontinue use when only 1/4 inch of wax remains in the vessel.

**What's the difference between 3-wick and single-wick candles?**

Three-wick candles contain higher concentrations of fragrance oils and fill large rooms more effectively with approximately 25-45 hours of burn time. Single-wick candles work better for smaller spaces like bathrooms or offices, offering lighter fragrance throw with longer burn times of 30-50 hours. Choose based on room size, fragrance intensity preference, and desired ambiance level.
